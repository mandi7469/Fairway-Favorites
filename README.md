## Description

Fairway Favorites is a react app that allows a user to search for their favorite disc golf disc and save it to their favorites collection. The application uses a real-world API to fetch for disc information and displays the name of the disc, category (ex. putter or driver) and flight information. The application also includes a "filter by flight" feature to search discs by speed, glide, turn and fade. Favorited discs are saved to local storage and can be removed from your favorites.
